NEAT Algorithm for Neural Networks

Inputs: Bird Y, Top Pipe, Bottom Pipe
Outputs: Jump
Activation Function: Hyperbolic Tangent (tan(h))
Population Size: 100 Birds (Neural Networks) -> Maximum Generations
Fitness Function: Evaluate how good the birds are (loss function?) (e.g. furthest bird)
Maximum Generations: Restarting if neural network is "unlucky"
